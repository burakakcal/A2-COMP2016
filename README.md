# INTERACTIVE APP



It is an interactive app so that users can post comments and have other upvote or downvote them.

I understood the concept following the videos and documentation on the following pisher tutorial page:https://pusher.com/tutorials/comment-voting-react-node. I also was looking for ways to implement the upvoting system using different ideas and I tried t implement something similar in this app.

After using git clone or downloading the repo
-	cd A2-COMP2016 (get into the A2-COMP2016 directory)
-	npm install on the A2-COMP2016 directory
-	cd client (to get into the client directory)
-	npm install
-	then from the root directory
-	npm run app
