# INTERACTIVE APP

The app works when I run the command to start the server and client at the same time, so I added the following command to start the app:
## npm run app

It is an interactive app so that users can post comments and have other upvote or downvote them.

I understood the concept following the videos and documentation on the following pisher tutorial page:https://pusher.com/tutorials/comment-voting-react-node. I also was looking for ways to implement the upvoting system using different ideas and I tried t implement something similar in this app.
